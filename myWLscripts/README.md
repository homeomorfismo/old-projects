# Personal Wolfram Languages Scripts

These are a bunch of exercies and scripts for personal study. I am using the Wolfram Kernel (script) in Jupyter Notebooks.

To run `.wls` codes, use in any terminal `wolframscript -rawterm -file PATH-TO-FILE`.

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

I am using Jupyter Notebooks with Wolfram Language code blocks. Moreover, I am using KaTeX extension, instead of MathJax. 

## Dynamical Systems with Application (using Mathematica)

I will be following this book. `ex` stands for *exercice*.
